Bookmark Manager Challenge
==================

Brief Summary of Approach
-------
We paired this week and encountered databases for the first time.  We played around in SQL before beginning this challenge, then built on our web app knowledge, this time requiring data to persist more permanently in a database.

Points for development:
* implement user accounts properly - with sign in/out (I did go on to learn this for the weekend 'Chitter' challenge)

Instructions
-------
* Clone this repository
* cd bookmark-manager
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* rackup (default tends to be localhost:9292)

User stories
--------

I want to be able to add new links to the favourites list

As a user
